I'm a post graduation student in data science  who loves open source programs and tools. I have bachelor degree in computer science period during which I developed my research using Python for data analysis and data processing.

Since then, I have studied python, data science, classic machine learning algorithms and neural networks. Therefore, I have made data science projects focused in business solutions with machine learning models.
